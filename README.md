### I'm Nicolás, programmer here in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I love the challenges, the knowledge and the opportunity to grow working as a team.
I love programming applications in .NET C #, Web Development with JS, HTML, CSS, Angular, Bootstrap and I want to be able to share my development knowledge with you.
Ok, without further ado, shall we code?
