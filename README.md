### I'm Nicol√°s, programmer here in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I like the challenges, the knowledge and the opportunity to work as a team.
I love programming applications in .NET C #, Web Development with JS, HTML, CSS, Angular, Bootstrap and I want to be able to share my development knowledge with you.
Ok, without further ado, shall we code?
